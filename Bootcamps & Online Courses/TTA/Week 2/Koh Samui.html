        <p>Ko Samui (or Koh Samui, also often locally shortened to Samui) is an island off the east coast of Thailand.</p>
        <p>Geographically in the Chumphon Archipelago, it is part of Surat Thani Province, though as of 2012, Ko Samui was granted municipal status and thus is now locally self-governing.</p>
