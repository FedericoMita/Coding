        <div>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">C.I.C.O stands for "Calories In, Calories Out" and it's an acronym of an equation our body performs every single day. 
                This process is based on the First Law of Thermodynamics or the Conservation of Energy, and does essentially mean that if you
                eat the same amount of calories that your budy burns every day to stay alive (the Basal Metabolic Rate), you will maintain the same weight and body composition (with few possible variations).<br>
                To cut it short, calories are what our body convert into ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) and NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + hydrogen),
                which are "energy molecules"<sup><a href="./index2.html">1</a></sup>. Whatever energy our body doesn't use, it converts it to fat tissue to store it, so reducing our calorie intake under our
                BMR means we'll burn some of that stored energy. This is called a "calorie deficit". On the contrary, if we eat more than what our body burns, we are in a calorie surplus and we'll gain fat tissue and weight.

        <h2><div id="Differences between individuals">Differences between individuals</div></h2>
        <div>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, our BMR varies wildly depending from person to person, that's why on the fancy calculators<sup><a href="./index2.html">2</a></sup> of the aforementioned on the web, they ask basic questions about 
            who we are. The result is alway an approximatino of our actual BMR (in this case called RMR, or Resting Metabolic Rate), but it's as close as we can go without actually getting into a laboratory. 
            There are other variables that factor into our BMR (and RMR) calculation, but the main three are as follow:
        </p>
    </div>
        <ul>
            <h3><div id="Male/Female"></div><li>Male/Female</li></h3>
            <div>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Studies have shown that our gender influences our BMR with an average difference of hundreds of kcal (kilocalories) between men and women, with men on the higher end. 
                But why men need more calories? Research suggests<sup><a href="./index2.html">3</a></sup> that the presence of naturally more muscle mass may be behind a higher calorie intake requirement.
            </p>
        </div>
            <h3><div id="Active/Inactive"></div><li>Active/Inactive</li></h3>
            <div>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The most obvious point: the more we are active and the more we burn calories past our normal BMR. On top of that, research<sup><a href="./index2.html">4</a></sup> indicates that doing medium-intense cardio 
            burns more calories than resistance training (weight lifting and the such), and the more is protracted the better for burning calories.
        </p>
    </div>
            <h3><div id="Young/Old"></div><li>Young/Old</li></h3>
            <div>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">As you age, you need fewer calories<sup><a href="./index2.html">5</a></sup> (possibly related to our natural decrease in muscle mass), so that's why it's harder to be in shape when we are older, compared to our teenage years. Our habits tend not to change, but our 
            calorie requirement does, so we find ourselves fatter without any apparent explanation. On a bright note, when we go way past our prime and become grizzled, our appetite goes down as well.
        </p>
    </div>
        </ul>
        <h2><div id="Differences between macronutrients"></div>Differences between macronutrients</h2>
        <div>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">What our bodies burn during the day, depends also on what we eat. Yes, a calorie is still a calorie, but different food groups require a different caloric use for our digestive 
        system to process. Long story short, some foods make us burn more calories (also called thermogenic effect<sup><a href="./index2.html">6</a></sup>) and which ones make us burn the most might surprise you. Fat, which by itself has around 9 kcal per gram, has a 
    TEF (Thermic Effect of Food, or the calories we burn to digest said food) of 0-3%; carbohydrate, 4 calories per gram, has a TEF between 5-10%; lastly, protein (4 calories per gram) has the highest TEF: 20-30%.<sup><a href="./index2.html">7</a>></a></sup>

        <h2><div id="Benefits"></div>Benefits</h2>
        <div>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The main benefit of tracking calories is being able to reach more easily a desired body weight, especially for weight loss (when in a calorie deficit)<sup><a href="./index2.html">8</a></sup>. Studies show that following 
        the doctors' recommendations for calorie intake, it's alone responsible for a good part of the fat lost, as shown in the image below.

        <h2><div id="Risks"></div>Risks</h2>
        <div>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The only possible, but still very much real and dangerous, downside of counting calories is doing just that. Only focusing on calories means we are neglecting to get a certain amount for every macronutrient, fibers and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). 
        Since a calorie is a calorie, one might have a diet full of processed food, sugars, saturated fats and still be in a calorie deficit. That's why it's important to consider everything, possibly counting other groups as well. Also, counting calories is not a substitute for physical 
    activity: the two should go hand in hand.<sup><a href="./index2.html">9</a></sup>

        <div>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In today society, we are bombarded by a myriad of fad diets, from "only-one-food" diets, to others more elaborate and bizarre, like having the diet of an ancestor or avoiding certain macronutrients.

            <div>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">They only thing that equates CICO to other effective diets (in weight loss) is that both can lead to calorie deficit, even though the latter usually reach that through some kind of abstinence.<sup><a href="./index2.html">10</a></sup>
                </p>

            <h3><div id="Differences from other diets"></div><li>Differences from other diets</li></h3>
            <div>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Fad diets, a lot more than CICO, promote an unhealthy and unbalanced food intake, often based upon outdated scientific research or, more often than not, no science at all. They can range 
                from a liquid diet, a food-specific and go all the way to fasting (which is no diet at all, being the absence of food).
            For example, the ketogenic diet (keto for short) is a diet prescribed to certain epilepsy patients, but has found popularity among fitness and diet fans, even though it's not the most healthy (promoting the lowest 
        possible consumption of charbohydrates).<sup><a href="./index2.html">11</a></sup>

        </ul>
        <h2><div id="Other influential factors"></div>Other influential factors</h2>
        <div><p style="text-align:justify">There are other deciding factors in determining how many calories we need/burn, such as genetics, weather, hormones, stress, tics, injuries, illnesses, etc., but in the end they 
        all account for a very slight percentage, compared to diet and exercise. For example, many believe hormones are the cause of their weight gain/loss, 
        but although hormones can play a (very small) part, the only equation certain to work and that is responsible for the majority of weight change is Calories In, Calories Out.
